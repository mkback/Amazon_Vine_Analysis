# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview 
#### In this challenge we analyzed Amazon reviews written by Amazon Vine program members. We performed the ETL process on this data using PySpark and connected to a database using AWS. 

## Results 
#### - There were 334 Vine Reviews and 61,614 non-Vine Reviews
#### - There were 139 5-star Vine Reviews and 32,665 non-Vine Reviews 
#### - 41% of the Vine Reviews were 5-star vs 53% of the non-Vine reviews.

## Summary 
#### Based on the above results, I do not think there is a positive bias for the reviews in the vine program. The vine reviews were actually less positive than those from Non-vine members.
